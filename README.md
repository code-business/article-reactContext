The project is structured for maintainability and follows best practices for a React TypeScript application.

## Features

- Dynamic notification system.
- Input field to enter custom notification messages.
- Clean and organized folder structure.
- Demonstrates the use of React Context API.
- Responsive and interactive user interface.
